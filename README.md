Cirrhosis of the liver is permanent scarring that damages your liver and interferes with its functioning. It can lead to liver failure. Cirrhosis is the result of persistent liver damage over many years. Alcohol and drugs, viruses and metabolic factors are the most common causes.

</p> In liver cirrhosis, there are mainly 4 stages which are as follows:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Stage 1 : Normal</li>
  <li>Stage 2 : Fatty Liver</li>
  <li>Stage 3 : Liver Fibrosis</li>
  <li>Stage 4 : Liver Cirrhosis</li>
</ol>
Cirrhosis is caused mainly by drinking too much alcohol for a long time, having viral hepatitis, or having a buildup of fat in your liver (fatty liver)
Symptoms include not feeling hungry, weight loss, and feeling weak and tired all over
Doctors can sometimes treat symptoms and problems of cirrhosis, but the damage to your liver is permanent


 </p> Symptoms and Causes
 </p> Signs and symptoms of cirrhosis depend on how advanced it is. You might not have symptoms at all early on, or you might only have vague symptoms that resemble many other conditions. Symptoms of cirrhosis become more recognizable as your liver function declines. For example, you might see signs that bile isn’t traveling where it needs to go, and instead is overflowing into places it doesn’t belong.
 </p> Early signs and symptoms of cirrhosis may include:
 </p> Visible blood vessels that look like spiders (spider angiomas).
 </p> Feeling generally ill (malaise).
 </p> Feeling weak or tired (fatigue).
 </p> Redness on the palms of your hands (palmar erythema).
 </p> symptoms of advancing cirrhosis?
 </p> Recognizable symptoms of cirrhosis fall into two categories: symptoms related to declining liver function, and symptoms related to portal hypertension. Symptoms of stalled bile flow, like jaundice, are common indicators of declining liver function. Symptoms of portal hypertension indicate cirrhosis specifically. It’s scar tissue in your liver that compresses your portal vein.
 </p> Dark-colored pee and light-colored poop.
Digestive difficulties, especially with fats.
</p> Small yellow bumps of fat deposits on your skin or eyelids.
</p> Motor dysfunction (twitching, tremors or lapses in muscle control).
</p> Disruptions to your menstrual cycle.
